---

If you want to save the data in your tables as csv files for one image layer, follow these steps
1. Select the image layer in the *Select layer to display table* dropdown menu.
2. Click on *Save selected data*.

If you want to save the data for all the images you quantified follow the same steps above but click *Save all data* instead of *Save selected data*.
